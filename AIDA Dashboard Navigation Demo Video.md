2. Dashboard overview and navigation
3. Case selection and review
4. Case editing and fact management
5. Submission workflow
6. Return to dashboard

## Technical Implementation

The prototype was built using:
- **React 18**: Component-based UI framework
- **React Router**: Client-side routing for navigation
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework
- **Vite**: Modern build tool and dev server

All assets from the original Figma design were properly imported and optimized as WebP images for fast loading and high quality display.

## Use Cases

This video demonstration is suitable for:
- **Stakeholder presentations**: Show the complete user experience
- **User testing**: Gather feedback on navigation and workflows
- **Development reference**: Guide implementation teams
- **Training materials**: Onboard new users to the system
- **Documentation**: Visual supplement to written specifications

## Next Steps

For a live interactive demo, the prototype can be deployed to a production environment where:
- All navigation flows are fully functional
- Users can interact with form fields
- Data can be entered and validated
- Real-time state management is active
- All transitions and animations work smoothly

## Notes

This video was created from high-fidelity design screenshots to demonstrate the intended user experience. The actual deployed prototype includes additional interactive features such as:
- Form validation
- Hover states and transitions
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Accessibility features
